## About

The Memory Game is written in javascript and runs entirely in the browser.  All testing was done with a Chrome browser. 

The game starts out with a timer running and 16 cards face down. Click 2 cards at a time to find a match. If the cards match, then these stay turned over. Otherwise these are flipped back to face down. The game proceeds like this until all matches found with all cards face up. 

A modal then pops up congratulating the player for finishing the game and displaying both the time it took with a score from 1 to 3 stars.  

The number of stars are based on the number of moves it took to find all matches. (A move is clicking on 2 cards to find a match.) If all cards are matched with 8 tries, the player receives a perfect score of 3 stars.  If all cards are matched within 12 tries, the player receives 2 stars. 1 star is awarded for moves of 13 or more to find all card matches.
